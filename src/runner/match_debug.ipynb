    "**Evidence**: flights from refers to ORIGIN; San Diego International airport refers to Description = 'San Diego, CA: San Diego International'; flights to refers to DEST; Los Angeles International airport refers to Description = 'Los Angeles, CA: Los Angeles International'; in the August of 2018 refers to FL_DATE like '2018/8%';\n",
    "\n",
    "** Query Plan**:\n",
    "\n",
    "** Preparation Steps: **\n",
    "1. Initialize the process: Set up the environment and prepare for query execution by initializing variables and temporary storage.\n",
    "2. Open required tables: Open the Airlines and Airports tables to access relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Identify Relevant Flights: **\n",
    "1. Fetch the FL_DATE column: Start reading the FL_DATE column from the Airlines table.\n",
    "2. Filter by August 2018: Use the condition FL_DATE LIKE '2018/8%' to filter flights that occurred in August 2018.\n",
    "3. Join with Airports for ORIGIN: Identify flights originating from 'San Diego, CA: San Diego International' by joining the Airlines table with the Airports table on the ORIGIN field.\n",
    "4. Join with Airports for DEST: Similarly, identify flights destined for 'Los Angeles, CA: Los Angeles International' by joining the Airlines table with the Airports table on the DEST field.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Count the Matching Flights: **\n",
    "1. Initialize the count: Set up a counter to keep track of how many flights match the criteria.\n",
    "2. Increment the count: For each flight that meets the conditions (originating from San Diego International and destined for Los Angeles International in August 2018), increment the counter.\n",
    "3. Store the final count: Once all rows have been processed, store the total count of matching flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Finalize and Deliver the Result: **\n",
    "1. Prepare the result for output: Format the final count for presentation, ensuring clarity and correctness.\n",
    "2. Output the final count: Deliver the count as the query result, indicating how many flights met the specified criteria.\n",
