CrewAI Multi-Tool Example

This example demonstrates using multiple external tools in a CrewAI workflow:
- BraveSearchTool: Web search via Brave Search API
- SerperScrapeWebsiteTool: Website scraping via Serper API

Required API keys (set as environment variables):
- BRAVE_API_KEY: Get from https://brave.com/search/api/
- SERPER_API_KEY: Get from https://serper.dev/
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: For the LLM

To run:
    export BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_api_key
    export SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
